# PiKaraoke is a "KTV"-style karaoke song search and queueing system. It connects to your TV, and shows a QR code for computers and smartphones
#  to connect to a web interface. From there, multiple users can seamlessly search your local track library, queue up songs, add an endless
#  selection of new karaoke tracks from YouTube, and more. Works on Raspberry Pi, OSX, Windows, and Linux!
